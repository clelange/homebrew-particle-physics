# My homebrew tap

A list of tools that I tend to install on new computers, which aren't part of the standard [Homebrew Formulae](https://formulae.brew.sh/).

See also https://github.com/davidchall/homebrew-hep for additional useful formulae.

## Installation

This is a [Homebrew Tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps).

```shell
brew tap clelange/particle-physics
```

Then you can install any of the available formulae below using `brew install <formula>`.

## Available formulae

- `voms-clients`

## Adding formulae

See the [Formula Cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook) for more information.
